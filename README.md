## Summary Notes On Asks
- [x] The header height if there were more lines of text in the PFA: *set min-height and height: auto for background and text to allow the height to grow*

- [x] The background visuals in the monitoring section: *use 2 images in background-display and set positions and size to contain*

- [x] The content in the 3 blue context boxes in monitoring and how you would make them responsive: *use @media and max-width to duplicate wrapper class with flex-direction column instead of row*

- [x] The alternating content in the Why Choose Advantage section: *use nth-of-item(even) pseudo to set flex-direction row-reverse*

- [ ] The top nav + logo + footer (optional): *no time*
